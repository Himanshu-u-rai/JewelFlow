## Entry [1] — 2026-05-28 — Stage 1: Capability Map Extension (MetalRegistry)

### Batch identity
- **Batch ID:** UX-2026-05-28-01
- **Plan stage:** Stage 1 from material-ux-alignment-plan.md §3
- **Status:** shipped

### What changed
- Added `MetalRegistry::uxItemCreationDefault(string $metal)`.
- Added `MetalRegistry::uxRatesDashboardVisible(string $metal)`.
- Added `MetalRegistry::uxItemPickerVisible(string $metal, int $shopId)`.
- Added `MetalRegistry::uxCustomerRateDisplayable(string $metal)`.
- Added `MetalRegistry::uxVaultPrimary(string $metal)`.
- Added `MetalRegistry::uxGramReconciliationDefault(string $metal)`.
- Added `tests/Feature/Material/MetalRegistryUxCapabilitiesTest.php` covering the 7 required UX capability cases.

### Why it changed
The operational audit required a stable, explicit UX capability layer so operator-facing screens default exactly like real jewelry shop workflows (gold/silver daily rate-first; platinum/copper piece-priced unless explicitly opted in; visibility rules aligned with reconciliation behavior). This batch provides that capability map without touching constitutional accounting triggers or DB schema.

### Files touched
- **Code:** `app/Services/MetalRegistry.php`
- **Tests:** `tests/Feature/Material/MetalRegistryUxCapabilitiesTest.php`
- **Docs:** `docs/journals/material-ux-alignment-journal.md`

### Migrations added
- None

### Risks introduced
- Unsupported/empty metal inputs now throw `InvalidArgumentException` in the new UX methods; any downstream code paths calling these methods with unexpected values would fail loudly instead of silently showing defaults.

### Rollback notes
Revert `app/Services/MetalRegistry.php` changes (remove the six `ux*` methods) and delete `tests/Feature/Material/MetalRegistryUxCapabilitiesTest.php`. No caches or data migrations are involved.

### Invariant impacts
- None

### Verification performed
- `php artisan test tests/Feature/Material/MetalRegistryUxCapabilitiesTest.php` — passed: ✓
- `php artisan test tests/Feature/ConstitutionalInvariantsTest.php` — passed: ✓
- `php artisan materials:audit` — exits 0: ✓

### Unresolved concerns
- None

### Operational rationale
Operator-facing screens can now consult a single, explicit UX capability map instead of guessing or duplicating metal-logic in views/controllers. This makes defaults and visibility match how jewelry shops run day-to-day while keeping constitutional accounting behavior untouched.
