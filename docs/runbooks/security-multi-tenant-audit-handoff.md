# Multi-tenant security audit — reviewable handoff

Branch `security/multi-tenant-audit`, worktree
`/home/himanshu/Desktop/jewelflow-worktrees/security-multi-tenant-audit`.

**Nothing in this branch has been pushed, deployed, or applied to any
environment other than the local `jewelflow_testing` database.** Every number
below is local evidence. Production exposure status is tracked separately and is
not improved by any of it.

Reported deployed baseline: `018b3d810e37d534f498033ab582ee41f3197c27`.
Verified as a local git object on 2026-09-21T00:37+05:30. That is a check of the
SHA I was **given**, not an observation of what is running on the servers.
Recheck for drift against the deployed tree before executing any approved step.

Mobile repository `/home/himanshu/Desktop/jewelflowMobileApp` at `d8a0781`
("chore(brand): close remaining JewelFlows branding gaps"). **I made no change to
that repository.** It carries one pre-existing dirty file, `src/utils/storage.ts`
(last written 2026-07-09, two months before this audit opened), plus untracked
scratch files that are not mine.

## 1. Three statuses, kept apart

These are routinely collapsed into one another, and collapsing them is how "we
wrote tests" becomes "it is fixed in production".

| Finding | Finding status | Local fix status | Deployed remediation |
|---|---|---|---|
| S3-01 KYC documents publicly readable | OPEN | Containment package written, not executed | **OPEN — nothing applied** |
| S3-01c legacy KYC rows | OPEN | Route fix committed (`4b6e5f3`) | **PENDING — not applicable is wrong; it needs the deploy** |
| S3-02 karigar attachment public | OPEN | Authenticated route + relocation command | **OPEN** |
| S3-02b karigar CHECK lacks the allowed-disk term | OPEN (logged, deliberately not fixed) | None by design | N/A |
| S3-03 purchase attachment public | OPEN | Authenticated route committed | **OPEN** |
| S3-04 signature public + mutable | OPEN | Option B implemented; immutability proven end to end | **OPEN** |
| S3-05 finalized invoice reprints with today's settings | **PARTIAL** — `igst_mode` + HSN fixed, 43 cosmetic reads still drift | Fix committed (`b216b80`), 8 tests | **OPEN** |
| S3-06 catalog tenant context survives a throw | **CLOSED as a code defect** — no cross-tenant read demonstrated | Fix committed (`721c06d`), 5 tests | **OPEN — needs the deploy** |
| S3-06b enabling a shopfront publishes every in-stock item | OPEN — product-consent gap, not a tenant break | Characterized (C-03), deliberately not repaired | N/A — feature decision, not an audit repair |
| S3-06c published item images outlive the shopfront toggle | OPEN | None — recorded limitation | **OPEN** |

### Corrections to my own earlier reports, restated here so they are not lost

* **S3-02 counts.** The read-only production metadata inventory reports **one**
  karigar attachment. Thirteen was the total across all confidential classes,
  not the karigar figure. I previously reported the larger number against the
  smaller finding.
* **"12 files is small enough to relocate by hand" is WITHDRAWN.** The count was
  never the risk. A manual copy gives no digest verification, no record of which
  rows were flipped, no resumption point, and no way afterwards to distinguish a
  file that was missed from one that was truncated. Superseded by
  `signatures:relocate`.
* **`uploads/` is explicitly tracked at zero files.** Zero today is not an
  argument that the directory is out of scope; it is a directory with no
  published-content decision recorded against it.
* **"~25 live billing reads in the print view" was wrong.** The count is **45**
  (`resources/views/invoice_print.blade.php`, 2026-09-21).
* **The signature work does not make historical rendering immutable.** It makes
  the *signature* immutable. See S3-05.
* **My own immutability tests were resting on their fixtures.** Detailed in §3.
* **Item images were mis-filed.** An earlier note listed
  `storage/app/public/items` beside `signatures/` and `kyc/` as
  "candidate-public assets pending classification", as though the three were
  alike. They are not. Signatures and KYC documents have **no feature that
  publishes them** — their public location is an accident of a default disk.
  Item images have a deliberate publishing feature: `routes/web.php` 94-100
  serves an unauthenticated shopfront at `/s/{slug}` that renders them by public
  URL on purpose, gated by `catalog_website_settings.is_enabled`, which is
  `default(false)` (`2026_04_01_000002_…:14`). This is the directive's "folder
  names do not establish publication consent" answered from the other side: the
  folder name did not establish consent here either — the **feature and its
  opt-in default** did. Verified by test, not by reading the route table:
  `PublicCatalogExposureTest` C-01/C-02 pin both halves.

---

## 2. KYC containment — awaiting explicit approval, not executed

Full package: `docs/runbooks/kyc-public-exposure-containment.md`.

Impact is stated as **"no identified first-party viewing regression"**. External
consumers remain unverified; that is a gap in the evidence, not a clean bill.

**Serving hostnames, named rather than counted.** Production vhost
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/jewelflow` line 24 serves `jewelflows.com`,
`www.jewelflows.com` and `dhiran.jewelflows.com`. Staging is a separate vhost
and a separate document root (`/var/www/jewelflow-staging/public`) and is
untouched by this package. `dhiran.jewelflows.com` is in scope **only** as a
third name resolving to the same document root — no part of this expands the
unrelated Dhiran business audit.

**Corrected Cloudflare expression.** `matches` requires Business or Enterprise,
so it is not available here:

```
(starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/storage/kyc/") and http.host in {"jewelflows.com" "www.jewelflows.com" "dhiran.jewelflows.com"})
```

**Purge entries are hostname-qualified.** A bare `/storage/kyc/` is incomplete —
Cloudflare keys the cache per hostname:

```
jewelflows.com/storage/kyc/
www.jewelflows.com/storage/kyc/
dhiran.jewelflows.com/storage/kyc/
```

Sequence remains **edge block → origin deny → purge**, subject to the ordering,
normalization, alias, HTTP/HTTPS and direct-origin checks recorded in the
runbook. Rollback is written so it **cannot silently restore public document
access**: reverting the edge rule alone leaves the origin `deny all` in place.

**BLOCKED dependency, named exactly:** no Cloudflare dashboard or API credential
is available to this session. The edge rule cannot be created or verified by me.
The origin-only option (§4a of the runbook) is independently approvable and does
not depend on it.

Cloudflare can convert a cacheable HEAD into an origin GET and cache the full
response, so verification uses a nonexistent probe path, not a real document.
No real KYC file has been repeatedly probed. Any production canary must be part
of the separately approved procedure.

## 3. S3-04 — what changed this session, and the defect it corrects in my own work

### The defect

`invoice_render_snapshots` had a reader (`InvoiceSignatureRenderer`) and a writer
(`InvoiceRenderSnapshotService::captureForInvoice`). The writer's **only caller
was the `BackfillAccountingSnapshots` console command.**
`InvoiceAccountingService::finalizeDraft()` captured a *compliance* snapshot and
no render snapshot at all.

`InvoiceSignatureEmbeddingTest` G-09 and G-16 assert the immutability property
and pass. Both fixtures call `captureForInvoice()` by hand. They prove the
renderer *reads* a snapshot correctly; they never proved one *exists*. I reported
that they did.

What kept it invisible is the renderer's fallback: with no snapshot row it drops
to live settings and still renders a signature — the wrong one, with no error.

### The fix

One call in `finalizeDraft()`, after the compliance block (which
`buildInvoiceSnapshot()` reads). Deliberately **not** wrapped in try/catch,
unlike the compliance snapshot above it: every caller runs `finalizeDraft` inside
a transaction, so on PostgreSQL a caught failure leaves an aborted transaction
and the following statements fail anyway. "Log and continue" there would be a
comment the database does not honour. *(That applies to the existing compliance
block too. Recorded, not widened into this change.)*

### The decisive regression, driven entirely through real routes

`tests/Feature/Security/SignatureImmutabilityEndToEndTest.php` — nothing captured
by hand, asserted against the HTML an operator would print.

| | |
|---|---|
| E-01 | finalizing via `PUT invoices.update` records a render snapshot |
| E-02 | **finalize under A → replace with B → disable signatures entirely → the invoice still prints A and never prints B** |
| E-03 | positive control: an invoice finalized under B prints B |
| E-04 | the enabled/disabled state is snapshotted too |
| E-05 | the same regression on the quick-bill path, via `POST quick-bills.store` |
| E-06 | positive control for E-05 |
| E-07 | relocate + purge, then the invoice still **prints** the bytes it was signed with |

E-01, E-02 and E-04 were red before the fix and green after.

### A fixture error worth recording, because it masqueraded as the finding

The first draft compared against the bytes it **uploaded**. It could never pass:
`SettingsController` → `SignatureStore` → `ImageOptimizer::optimizeAndStore`
re-encodes every raster upload to WebP under a fresh ULID, so the uploaded bytes
are never on disk. It also distinguished A from B by a trailing byte, which sits
outside the image data and is dropped by GD — both "different" signatures would
have encoded identically. A and B are now told apart by **dimensions**
(ImageOptimizer downscales only), and assertions are against the **stored** file.

This is exactly the failure the evidence discipline exists to catch: E-03, the
positive control, was failing, which is the only reason I did not read E-02's
red as the finding reproducing.

### Attribution by mutation, not by counting

| Mutation | Result |
|---|---|
| Remove the three signature keys from `QuickBillService::shopSnapshot()` | E-05 **killed**. E-06 **survived** |
| Replace the ledger lookup in `InvoiceSignatureRenderer` with `null` | E-07 **killed** |

E-06's survival is legitimate and is the reason it exists. It issues a bill under
B and expects B; with no snapshot the renderer falls back to live settings, which
still hold B. A positive control is *supposed* to pass under the broken
implementation — if it died too it would be duplicating E-05, not bounding it.

Restoration in both cases was confirmed by `git diff` returning empty on the
mutated file **plus** a green rerun of the affected tests. Not by searching for
the absence of a marker word.

---

## 4. Protecting the embedded data

Base64 is an encoding, not access control. What protects it:

* `InvoiceSignatureRenderer::authorize()` runs **before any storage read** —
  active shop must match the bill's shop, and `Gate::denies('sales.view')`
  aborts. Duplicated from the route middleware on purpose: four callers render
  these views, and a fifth must not be able to inline bytes by forgetting a gate.
* Trusted references only: disk restricted to `['public','local']`, traversal and
  absolute paths refused, and the path must be under this shop's signature
  directory. No request input reaches any of it.
* Content validated by `getimagesizefromstring`, not by extension; size checked
  from metadata **before** the bytes are loaded; dimensions bounded at 2000 px.
* Read and encoded once per render, memoized per bill.
* `NoCache` middleware on both web print routes and both mobile template routes
  (G-21, G-22). The framework default already sends an unqualified `private`,
  which forbids *shared*-cache storage; `no-store` adds the private caches that
  permits — the till browser's disk cache and the mobile WebView cache. **No CDN
  has been observed honouring these headers. Do not read G-21/G-22 as edge
  verification.**
* Diagnostics never log the path. `unavailable()` logs a reason and a truncated
  SHA-256 of the path only.

**Measured payload growth at the supported maximum** (G-14, `copy_count` server
max is `in:1,2`; upload max 512 KB):

```
file=524,287 B  base64=699,052 B
html without signature =    69,444 B
html with signature    = 1,467,710 B
growth = 1,398,266 B  (2.00x the encoded length, i.e. once per copy)
```

That is a ~21x document. It is the **bound**, not the typical case: G-14 writes
the maximum-size file directly to disk, bypassing `ImageOptimizer`, which in the
real upload path re-encodes to WebP. `ponytail:` the data URI is repeated once
per copy. Ceiling named — if a real shop's signature ever makes this hurt, the
upgrade path is to emit the base64 once in a `<style>` block as a CSS custom
property and reference it from each copy, which makes growth independent of
`copy_count`. Not done speculatively.

---

## 5. Mobile — verified, and explicitly NOT RUN

Installed printing dependencies (`package.json`): `expo-print ~15.0.8`,
`expo-sharing ~14.0.7`, `react-native-webview 13.15.0`.

Actual call sites — all four, with no others:

```
app/invoice/[id].tsx:95      Print.printToFileAsync({ html })
app/invoice/[id].tsx:117     Print.printAsync({ html })
app/quick-bill/[id].tsx:121  Print.printToFileAsync({ html })
app/quick-bill/[id].tsx:143  Print.printAsync({ html })
```

**`useMarkupFormatter` is passed nowhere in the repository** (grep across all
`.ts`/`.tsx` outside `node_modules`: zero matches). That matters because that
option does not display images. Its absence means the default WebView renderer is
used, which does render `<img src="data:...">`. This is **feasibility evidence
from the real call sites** — stronger than the Expo documentation alone, and
still not proof that it works on a given handset.

**Cache review — a verified negative.** React Query is persisted to AsyncStorage
(`PersistQueryClientProvider`, `src/lib/query-client.ts`), so it was worth
checking whether signature bytes land in cleartext on a shop tablet. They do not:
`shouldDehydrateQuery` persists only an allowlist —
`categories`, `catalog-template`, `catalog-categories`, `material-registry`. The
HTML-bearing query key is `['invoice-template', invoiceId]`, which is not in it.
The quick-bill template is not in the query cache at all; it is fetched
imperatively at `app/quick-bill/[id].tsx:96`. Residual: the invoice template stays
in the **in-memory** cache for up to `gcTime` (24 h). Memory, not disk.

### NOT RUN — exact remaining checks

| Check | Status | Exactly what remains |
|---|---|---|
| Android print preview renders the inline signature | **NOT RUN** | Build a dev client, open a finalized invoice, tap Print, confirm the signature appears in the Android print preview and in the shared PDF |
| iOS print/share renders the inline signature | **NOT RUN** | Same, on a physical iOS device — no simulator, `Print.printAsync` behaviour differs |
| Multiple copies on device | **NOT RUN** | Set `copy_count` = 2, confirm both copies carry the image and the PDF is not rejected for size |
| Desktop browser print dialog | **NOT RUN** | `GET /invoices/{id}/print` in Chrome and Firefox, confirm the image survives into the print preview |
| CSP behaviour for `data:` images | **NOT RUN** | No `Content-Security-Policy` header is currently emitted on the print routes; if one is added, `img-src` must include `data:` |
| Mobile "Signature unavailable" on-screen banner | **NOT DONE** | Both screens currently only `Alert.alert('Print Failed', …)`. The printed document *does* carry the marker (it is in the HTML); the on-screen banner is separate and unbuilt |

---

## 6. Migrations — dependency order

Full reasoning: `docs/runbooks/signature-migration-release-order.md`. **Status:
PROPOSED. Nothing executed anywhere but `jewelflow_testing`.**

| Phase | Migrations | Safe while baseline serves? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 EXPAND | `2026_09_15_120000` karigar disk, `2026_09_15_140000` purchase disk, `2026_09_16_120000` signature disk, `2026_09_20_120000` `signature_relocations` | Yes — nullable columns and a new table |
| 2 APPLICATION | deploy the new code to **every** serving node | — |
| 3 CONTRACT | `2026_09_20_130000` all three both-or-neither CHECKs | **No.** Must not run before Phase 2 completes |

The correction this split exists for: I called the original three migrations
"additive" and treated that as safe-while-serving. The column and backfill are
additive. **The constraint is not** — it forbids a row with a path and no disk,
and that is exactly what baseline `018b3d8` writes on every upload
(`SettingsController:526-527`, `StockPurchaseController:140,354`,
`KarigarInvoiceService:49,114`). Demonstrated by `DiskColumnReleaseOrderTest`
T-01/T-03/T-05; T-02 is the expand-only positive control.

Phase 3 reconciles **immediately before** enforcing, in both directions, because
the Phase 1 backfill ran before the window it authorises. It adds each constraint
`NOT VALID` then `VALIDATE`s it — `NOT VALID` takes `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` only
briefly and still enforces on every subsequent INSERT/UPDATE; `VALIDATE` scans
under `SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE`, blocking neither reads nor writes. T-06 asserts
`pg_constraint.convalidated`, which is the only signal separating a validated
constraint from one that reports a successful deploy while permanently exempting
every expand-window row. T-07 pins the reconciliation.

`signature_relocations` (`2026_09_20_120000`) is required by
`SignatureRelocationLedger`, which `InvoiceSignatureRenderer` and
`RelocateShopSignatures` both depend on. No ordering relationship to Phase 3.

**Rollback is not symmetric.** Phase 3 `down()` is freely reversible. Phase 1
rollback drops the disk columns — which is the only record of which files the new
code put on the private disk, and of which have been relocated. Treat Phase 1
rollback as **one-way** once any private upload or relocation has occurred;
revert the code and leave the columns.

---

## 7. File repairs and relocation — still OPEN

`signatures:relocate` and `karigar:relocate-attachments` are both dry-run by
default, bounded by `--shop`/`--limit`, copy-and-rehash at the destination before
any metadata moves, write a JSONL manifest, and keep originals until a separately
gated `--purge-originals`. The purge refuses any original with no ledger row
(R-18), and refuses wholesale when any private copy is missing (R-12).

Signatures differ from karigar attachments in a way that drives the design: a
karigar attachment is named by exactly one row, so flipping that row describes
the move completely. A signature is named by the mutable settings row **and** by
every `invoice_render_snapshots` row and `quick_bills.shop_snapshot` captured
while it was current — immutable, unbounded, and explicitly not rewritable. The
command updates the first and never touches the second; the relocation ledger is
what makes that safe, and E-07 proves it on the printed page.

**Still open, and not to be closed by this branch:**

* Public copies remain exposed until containment or an approved purge. Relocation
  copies; it does not remove the public original until the gated purge runs.
* Purchase and karigar repairs stay OPEN until their access paths and **web and
  mobile consumers** are each addressed. Authorized viewing of existing files is
  preserved by the authenticated routes; that is verified locally only.
* Item images and other candidate-public assets stay under review. A folder named
  `public` records no publication decision, and a handful of absent grep matches
  does not prove a dynamically built URL has no consumer.
  **Item images are now classified** (see §7a) — they have a real publishing
  feature, so they are NOT relocation candidates. The remaining public-disk
  destinations are not: `products`, `shop-logos`, `catalog-heroes`,
  `UploadIntentService:110,251` and `Api\Mobile\ItemController:226,495` are still
  unclassified and stay under review. Enumerated by grep over
  `Storage::disk('public')` writes on 2026-09-21; that enumerates *writers*, not
  consumers, and a consumer is what decides publication.
* Superseded signature versions are named by no settings row — only by snapshots.
  `--orphans` reports them; the default pass does not move them, because moving a
  file that no row names would strip the only pointer to it.
* **If an image was already overwritten or deleted by the baseline's
  `Storage::delete()` calls, it is gone. It cannot be reconstructed.** Nothing
  here claims otherwise.

---

## 7a. S3-06 — the public catalog, and the one defect in it

**How this came up.** Directive item 7 says folder names do not establish
publication consent. Classifying `storage/app/public/items` meant finding what
actually publishes item images, and that search found a route group I had not
audited: `routes/web.php` 94-100 serves `/s/{slug}` — a whole shopfront, product
list and category pages — with **no authentication at all**.

**The gate, verified rather than assumed.** `ResolveCatalogShop` requires all
three of: a shop whose `catalog_slug` matches, that shop being `active()`, and
`catalog_website_settings.is_enabled`. That column is `default(false)`, so a shop
publishes nothing until someone switches it on. C-01 proves an enabled shopfront
serves a logged-out visitor; C-02 proves a shop that never opted in gets a 404
and leaks no sentinel. "It is opt-in" is worth exactly what the test proving it
is worth.

**The defect (S3-06).** The middleware set tenant context from the anonymous
visitor's URL segment and cleared it only after `$next($request)` returned. Any
throw in between skipped the clear. `EnsureTenantUser:31-32` has used
`try/finally` all along; the asymmetry was the finding. Fixed in `721c06d`.

*Bounded honestly:* no cross-tenant read is demonstrated, and `composer.json` has
no Octane, so no worker carries stale context into a different visitor's request.
What it was, was a missing guard on the one route group whose tenant comes from
an unauthenticated URL rather than a session.

**Two things this does NOT fix, recorded as findings rather than repaired:**

* **S3-06b — consent is per SHOP, publication is per ITEM.**
  `PublicCatalogWebsiteController::products()` lists `Item::where('status',
  'in_stock')` with no per-item opt-out, so enabling the shopfront publishes
  every in-stock piece — barcode, design, category, price, photo — not a chosen
  subset. C-03 characterizes this. If someone later adds a per-item flag, C-03
  **should** fail; that failure is the feature landing. This is a
  product-consent question, not a tenant-isolation break, and adding the flag is
  a feature decision rather than an audit repair.
* **S3-06c — the image files outlive the gate.** Turning the shopfront off makes
  the pages 404. It moves no bytes: photos stay readable at
  `/storage/items/<ULID>.webp` to anyone holding the URL. Filenames are
  `Str::ulid()->toBase32()` (`ImageOptimizer:72,80`), whose low 80 bits are
  random, so they are not enumerable by guessing — but a URL that was shared,
  screenshotted or logged keeps working. A limitation, not a repair.

**Cross-shop isolation on this route group gets its own test (C-04)** because
every other isolation test in the suite has a logged-in principal whose
`shop_id` the scope keys off. Here there is none — the tenant is chosen by an
anonymous URL segment, which makes it the one place a missing scope would expose
another shop's inventory to the open internet.

## 8. Commands actually run, and their results

```
php artisan test tests/Feature/Security/SignatureImmutabilityEndToEndTest.php
  -> 7 passed, 65 assertions

php artisan test tests/Feature/Security/FinalizedInvoiceSettingsDriftTest.php
  -> 8 passed, 31 assertions

php artisan test tests/Feature/Security/PublicCatalogExposureTest.php
  -> BEFORE the fix: 1 failed, 4 passed (15 assertions)
     C-05 "Failed asserting that 6 is null" -- 6 is the shop id, still
     pinned after the handler threw. RED for the intended reason.
  -> AFTER  the fix: 5 passed, 16 assertions

php artisan test --filter='Catalog|Tenant|Middleware|Share'
  -> 120 passed, 414 assertions   (S3-06 regression band)

php artisan test tests/Feature/Security tests/Feature/Mobile
  -> 216 passed, 753 assertions   (re-measured after S3-06)
     Was 211 / 737 before PublicCatalogExposureTest existed. Arithmetic
     would have predicted 216 / 753 and would have been right -- it was
     re-run anyway, because three wrong diffstats earlier in this session
     all came from computing a figure instead of measuring one.

php artisan test --filter='Invoice|Sales|Exchange|Installment|Return|QuickBill|Repair|Gst|Tax|Snapshot|Setting'
  -> 594 passed, 3 skipped, 2311 assertions
```

**The Vite failures, reported explicitly.** The second command first returned
**63 failed**. Every one of them was `Vite manifest not found` — 212 occurrences
across 63 tests, with no second cause. `.gitignore:20` excludes `/public/build`,
and `git worktree add` materialises only tracked files, so a fresh worktree has
no built assets and every test rendering a view that extends
`layouts/app.blade.php` dies in `@vite`. 63 was the number of tests that render a
layout, not the number of broken ones. Restored by symlinking `node_modules` from
the primary checkout and running `npm run build` in the worktree; the rerun above
is the result. **This was not caused by, and did not mask, any change in this
branch.**

Scenario-family coverage, reported separately from the test count because a count
is not coverage:

| Family | Covered |
|---|---|
| Authorized positive control | yes |
| Another shop | yes |
| Same-shop staff lacking permission | yes (G-15) |
| Guest | yes (G-01) |
| Legacy storage compatibility | yes (G-11, G-19, E-07) |
| New/private storage | yes |
| Mixed-disk estate | yes |
| Missing / unreadable / invalid signature | yes (G-07, G-08, G-20) |
| Immutable historical rendering | yes (E-01…E-07) |
| Immutable tax characterization | yes (D-01…D-08) |
| Release ordering | yes (T-01…T-07) |
| Unauthenticated route, cross-shop isolation | yes (C-04) |
| Unauthenticated route, context release on throw | yes (C-02, C-05) |
| Publication consent gate, both halves | yes (C-01 enabled, C-02 not enabled) |
| **Per-item publication opt-out** | **none exists — characterized by C-03, not covered** |
| **On-device print** | **NOT RUN — see §5** |
| **Edge cache behaviour** | **NOT RUN — no Cloudflare access** |

## 9. Commits, diff, working tree

**Measured at `721c06d`, not at HEAD — deliberately.** A diffstat recorded inside
a tracked file changes the diffstat, so "the figure at HEAD" has no fixed point,
and chasing it is exactly how the earlier revisions of this line came to be
wrong. Pinning it to a named commit makes it rerunnable:

```
$ git diff --shortstat 018b3d8..721c06d
 51 files changed, 8920 insertions(+), 95 deletions(-)

$ git log --oneline 018b3d8..721c06d | wc -l
28
```

`721c06d` is the last **code** commit on the branch; every commit after it is an
edit to this document. The previous pin was `e12c6c5` at 49 files / +8,641 / −69,
superseded by the S3-06 work rather than corrected.

**Three revisions of this one line were wrong, recorded rather than quietly
overwritten.** The first claimed "22 commits, 46 files, +7,813 / −54", carried
over from an earlier point in the branch. The second claimed "+8,642 / −77",
which I got by adding the size of my own edit to an earlier reading — arithmetic,
not evidence, and wrong by one insertion and eight deletions. The third pasted
real output but labelled it "at HEAD", which the act of pasting falsified. Any
number in this document not traceable to a named command at a named commit
should be treated as unverified.

This session added:

```
7fc27cf  Capture a render snapshot at finalization (S3-04)
0ae6b15  Drive the quick-bill signature regression through real routes (S3-04)
1eef5b2  Prove relocation preserves the signature on the printed page (S3-04)
c211264  Record the audit handoff: separated statuses and pending containment
b216b80  Print a finalized bill's tax as it was issued, not as today (S3-05)
721c06d  Release the catalog tenant context even when the handler throws (S3-06)
```

(plus, earlier in the same session: `a542745` migration split, `ad9babe` runbook
de-duplication, `2f26386` S3-05 characterization tests.)

**Working tree is clean. No dirty or untracked files in this repository.**
Untracked-but-ignored artifacts exist and are intentional: `node_modules`
(a symlink to the primary checkout) and `public/build` (Vite output), both
covered by `.gitignore`.

## 10. Next, while production approval is pending

1. S3-05's **statutory half is fixed** (`b216b80`): `igst_mode` and the HSN map
   now come from the bill's own snapshot on all five render paths (web invoice,
   web quick bill, quick-bill original, and both mobile HTML endpoints), with
   the same read-time legacy defaulting the signature snapshot uses. **The
   cosmetic half is not fixed** — 43 live settings reads (theme colour, font
   tier, paper size, subtitle, tagline) still re-resolve at reprint, and bills
   finalized before these keys were captured still fall back to live settings.
   S3-05 therefore stays PARTIAL, not closed.
2. The mobile on-screen "Signature unavailable" banner (§5).
3. Remaining model/route/job/cache investigations.
4. The tracked backup repair.
5. Item-image and candidate-public asset classification (§7).
